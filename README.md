# Prmission TypeScript SDK

TypeScript SDK for integrating consent-gated data access, escrow, and USDC settlement into AI agents and apps on Base.

Official SDK for the Prmission Protocol.

## Why this SDK

Prmission lets apps and autonomous agents request permission, deposit escrow, report outcomes, settle payments, and read live protocol state on-chain.

Use this SDK if you are building:
- AI agent payment flows
- consent-gated data transactions
- merchant or marketplace backends
- wallets or frontends on Base
- developer tooling around Prmission Protocol
